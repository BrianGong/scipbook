  abstract = {In this paper, the methods for stock cutting outlined in an earlier
	paper in this Journal [Opns Res 9, 849-859 (1961)] are extended and
	adapted to the specific full-scale paper trim problem. The paper
	describes a new and faster knapsack method, experiments, and formulation
	changes. The experiments include ones used to evaluate speed-up devices
	and to explore a connection with integer programming. Other experiments
	give waste as a function of stock length, examine the effect of multiple
	stock lengths on waste, and the effect of a cutting knife limitation.
	The formulation changes discussed are (i) limitation on the number
	of cutting knives available, (n) balancing of multiple machine usage
	when orders are being filled from more than one machine, and (m)
	introduction of a rational objective function when customers' orders
	are not for fixed amounts, but rather for a range of amounts. The
	methods developed are also applicable to a variety of cutting problems
	outside of the paper industry.},

  title = {A Linear Programming Approach to the Cutting-Stock Problem},
  journal = {Operations Research},

  pages = {849--859},
  number = {6},
  abstract = {The cutting-stock problem is the problem of filling an order at minimum
	cost for specified numbers of lengths of material to be cut from
	given stock lengths of given cost. When expressed as an integer programming
	problem the large number of variables involved generally makes computation
	infeasible. This same difficulty persists when only an approximate
	solution is being sought by linear programming. In this paper, a
	technique is described for overcoming the difficulty in the linear
	programming formulation of the problem. The technique enables one
	to compute always with a matrix which has no more columns than it
	has rows.},
